# Joining the team
Joining the PHP Documentation team is a simple process, but a process nonetheless. It can be summarized as:

## Write a list
Because official communication is done there, you should write the proper list. Say “Hi” and what you're interested
in doing. You may feel more comfortable lurking for awhile, or reading the archives, or hanging out in IRC
(#php.doc on Efnet) for awhile, but ultimately let the list know who you are.

### For editors
You should send your message to `phpdoc@lists.php.net` mailinglist.

### For translators
You should send your message to `doc-{LANG}@lists.php.net` mailinglist.

## Create a doc patch or three
This step is required to show us that you are a real human, you want to do some work and in general know how to do this.

The simplest way to get started is by using  the [Online Documentation Editor](https://wiki.php.net/doc/editor)
which allows you to login via Facebook/Twitter/Google account and edit documentation. Your patches will be then
reviewed and accepted by someone with SVN access.

## Obtaining SVN access
If you plan to contribute to manual regularly and want to do this more efficiently, you probably would like to 
use SVN directly. To request for PHP.net account, please fill in [this form](http://php.net/git-php.php). Provide links
to your commits or list your patches on textarea field. Basically, tell us what have done, to prove that you really
need this account.

Next chapter will explain how to get manual sources and how are they [structured](structure.md).
