## Introduction
PHP is well known for having excellent documentation, documentation that is created by volunteers who
collectively make changes every day. This guide is designed for people who work on the official PHP documentation.

## Glossary
This guide use some terminology you have to know. Don't worry, it's easy:
- **editor** - person who contributes to original English manual
- **translator** - person who translates English manual into another language
- **{LANG}** - replace it with your two-letter country code, in example in mailing list address (note: Brazilian Portuguese
format differs from the rest and it's called *pt_BR* for SVN module and *pt-br* for mailing list sufix). If you edit
original PHP Manual your language code is *en*.
