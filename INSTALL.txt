Initial Installation
---------------------

1. Run ./configure [--help]
2. You need to run the scripts/populatedocs.sh to fetch all the required
   documentation for the site.
3. Create the SQLite and files directories and chown them to the user and
   group who apache runs under. (see scripts/set_ownership.sh)
4. Generate the initial SQLite databases by running the following scripts:
   scripts/setup_users_database.php
   scripts/setup_rfc_database.php
   scripts/setup_tests_database.php
5. The PEAR packages for the RFC System can be found at include/rfc/PACKAGES
   You will also need to have: XML_RSS, XML_Parser
6. A cronjob should be setup to run include/rfc/rfc-cron.php at 4am
7. You may want to create a www/robots.txt to allow or disallow bots crawling
   your local docweb development site.
